	- Whatsapp group (~200) -> leave a message with phone/LinkedIn to start
	- Annie(sp?) is working as HR for UK company (Shown as Jeffery Chan - her husband -  he is an IT personnel too)
	- 9:12 - unemployment rate low, job title more "honest", recommend [National Career Service](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/)
	- 9:16 - Indeed: 60% of all vacancies, near monopoly, HR will post on Indeed because it's free and has collaboration
	- 9:18 - Glassdoor: For checking companies, 70% truth
	- 9:19 - LinkedIn: More of a social network and for higher titles and headhunters
	- 9:20 - Reed: Better search than indeed, recruitment agency better than Indeed
	- 9:21 - TotalJobs: Nearly identical to Indeed (same holding company)
	- 9:21 - CV-Library: Not heard of it (?!), not much job for IT
	- 9:22 - NHS Jobs: some IT jobs
	- 9:22 - Fish4Jobs for Manchester/Liverpool/Birimingham newspaper, so better for regional
	- 9:23 - Gov.UK: HKer actually got job from the government?!
	- 9:24 - UK has less large/international companies, more SME (with part time HR at best) so they rely on talent agency
	- 9:25 - all IT jobs in demand (no. 1 lacking), IT backward (?!). Suggest recruitment agency if no work
	- 9:27 - Need UK Local experience, preparedness (honesty), attitude/drive (what effort you spent on learning those), social skills (blow water at the first level, homework done, what can be extended), teamwork, cultural fit (match)
	- 9:31 - Which job - key words, importance in sequence (top to bottom), style (wording/tone), length (longer = more demanding), view ads posted within 1 week
	- 9:36 - Example Ad with some repeating words
	- 9:37 - Must match keyword (but not direct copy), not 100% AI, personal statement is must (good summary but for looks only), within two pages (2 pages if more than 10 years), must give summary for companies, no need to write more than "Hong Kong", no APAC (Asia)
	- 9:43 - CV includes: work exp, no age discrimination (not even write age), focus on recent 2-3 jobs, education & qualification (list more but not too many), tone/story want to tell (doer/teamplayers/leader), 3-5 unique stuff (personally qualities), Must include: right to work (just mention it), don't write visa (filtered by AI), mode of work (with postcode) unless 100% remote, availability (),  languages (English), salary (possibly don't mention it) - lower range for negotiation
	- 9:49 - Writing CV: no job jumping penalty, neither gap in CV, too long in same job (can mention reporting line), change field (must be ready if so), NO cover letter (?!?!!?)
	- 9:51 - Example CV: Photo if handsome (?!), mostly two columns
	- 9:52 - MUST research company and industry (industry website may mention it), suggest networking/webinar, write down Q&A potential from job description, MUST mention what support is needed (honest), ASK QUESTIONS (simple stuff), talk about salary (lower first)
	- 9:54 - Situational interview (problem solve, what recourse or has experience), professional (SUIT!!!), be social/energetic (hold a dialog), want to know "HOW", if keep failing job then might check mock interviews, mention how to do the job despite no UK experience (by studying and research) or how it is revelent to the UK, ask question, be precise and practice (better vocab and less dead air)
	- 9:59 - Interview reply within 2 wks, no one bother to reject you, always followup (I guess with some items of the interview), calc the actual take home salary and T&C before replying
	- 10:01 - Q&A starts (ask us to fill in eval form)
	- 10:02 - degrees/master not too important.
	- 10:03 - Anthony Leung ask diff. between big/small company IT (answered by Jeffery - big company has HR -> line manager -> teammate, situational answer can be who to delegate, not much big questions).
	- 10:07 - KT Tang ask if HR can detect ChatGPT CV - answer: you can use it as basis but don't copy since you can't answer.
	- 10:08 - Chris Chan ask (1) current big company hiring climate, and (2) if there are any problem with interview again - answer: now is bad time for job, suggest contract job, join companies in Q1/2 only; should send email asking why he is not hired. Big companies has wait list so useful for subsequent interviews to keep contact with HR.
	- 10:11 - Kam Fung Ling ask if there are anything wrong with his CV since there are nearly no interviews. Seems he has address but not postcode. He used ChatGPT but Annie said maybe he was detected as he did not change the wordings. Annie suggested finding a recruitment agency to help with his CV. Mike said he can ask in whatsapp group.
	- 10:14 - Wong Noel looks for UI work, can pass screening tests but no interview by line manager and ask what's wrong. Annie asked HR should discuss with line manager first, and may have a problem with CV. She also suggested follow 80/20 rule on ChatGPT CV and modifying the tone of the CV.
	- 10:19 - Kam Fung Ling asks again - about jobs that are outside IR35, if it can be taken. Annie said yes, and contrary to expectation contract will often get renewed. Mike asked more information on IR35 and Annie said UK government website.
	- 10:21 - Anthony has another question - he was project manager and want to know if it's harder to find in UK. Annie said she knows of at least two from HK who got it, but PM are a bit less technical with more focus on leadership/management skills and may be harder to land. Annie stress again the HOW is important, as every applicant is the same. Jeffrey suggest just to cover key projects, and stress again delegation is important. Annie also suggests using LinkedIn to find a diverse company (easier to fit in).
	- 10:24 - Joe Chan asks whether one can trust salary reports. Annie answer that a good reference is the average of Indeed, Glassdoor and Payscale (while MichaelPage and Hays are not realistic). She said HR has a budget and should wait for them to contact.
	- 10:28 - Mike plug their fan page, another upcoming webinar by an Amazon Account manager (whatsapp only)
	- 10:29 - Meeting ends. Total running time ~90min. They will probably share the Powerpoint later.
